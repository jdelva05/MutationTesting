# Mutation Testing Report for Polynomial Class
## Introduction
A sophisticated software testing method called "mutation testing" entails making small changes to a program's source code, or "mutants," and then observing whether the test suite recognizes (or eliminates) these modifications. The procedure aids in assessing how well the test suite finds errors. An overview of the mutation testing done on the Polynomial class is given in this report.
