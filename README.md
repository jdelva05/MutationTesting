# Mutation Testing Report for Polynomial Class
## Introduction
A sophisticated software testing method called "mutation testing" entails making small changes to a program's source code, or "mutants," and then observing whether the test suite recognizes (or eliminates) these modifications. The procedure aids in assessing how well the test suite finds errors. An overview of the mutation testing done on the Polynomial class is given in this report.
## List of Defined Mutation Operators
The methods by which the source code is changed to create mutants are known as mutation operators. For the Polynomial class, the following mutation operators were defined:
1. Arithmetic Operator Replacement: Changing arithmetic operators (e.g., + to -, * to /).
2. Logical Connector Replacement: Altering logical connectors in conditionals (e.g., and to or).
3. Relational Operator Replacement: Modifying relational operators (e.g., > to <, == to !=).
4. Constant Replacement: Adjusting constant values in expressions.
5. Statement Removal: Removing specific statements or expressions.
## Description of Applied Mutations and Their Impact
Several aspects of the Polynomial class were mutated, such as the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation procedures. These mutations had a variety of effects, such as inaccurate polynomial computations, runtime errors, and failed tests.
## Summary of Mutant Survival and Killing
- Errors (7 Mutations): A few of the mutations caused runtime errors, which could be signs of syntax problems or potential exceptions.
- Found (10 Mutations): The test suite found most of the mutations, indicating some degree of success in finding problems.
- Survived (2 Mutations): A few mutations made it through the testing procedure, pointing out places where the test suite might be strengthened for more comprehensive coverage.
## Analysis of the Test Suite's Effectiveness
The test suite proved useful in identifying a good number of mutations, particularly those pertaining to the fundamental features of polynomial operations. There is still opportunity for improvement, though, given that two mutations survived. The test suite's coverage of a range of polynomial scenarios, including edge cases, is what makes it so effective.
## Recommendations for Improving the Test Suite
To improve the test suite:
1. Take Care of Surviving Mutations: Examine the surviving mutations to determine why they were missed, and then develop new tests or improve current ones to account for these possibilities.
2. Extend Coverage: Test a wider range of input values and combinations, paying close attention to boundary values and uncommon situations.
3. Examine Error-Inducing Mutations: Look into the errors brought on by mutations to make sure they don't indicate real bugs that the test suite ought to detect.
## Conclusion
Important information about the resilience of the Polynomial class test suite was obtained through mutation testing. Although the suite was successful in identifying a large number of introduced defects, the process also identified certain flaws that could be fixed. The test suite can be further strengthened by implementing the suggestions in this report, which will result in a more dependable and maintainable Polynomial class implementation.
